Notes: 

	This script attempts to update in-place content related to the OneGet API
	definitions so that we don't have to keep them up-to-date manaully.

	It also generates the API stubs in the dependent places, which ensures that
	our default impementations are kept up-to-date with new APIs that are provided
	by OneGet.


Results:

	First, we're going to go out and find out which classes declare delegates that
	we're going to consume:

	StartingFolder: C:\root\oneget

	Categories:
		host-supplied
		collection
		core-supplied
		service-api

	Now, we're going to scan thru all the files and find the ones where there are
	places to copy the results into.
