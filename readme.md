| Branch | Purpose |
| ------- | ---------------------------|
|@fearthecowboy|  Architect, Lead Developer, and gunslinger coalesced into human form. I'm a code-first, consequences-be-damned, software developer who likes feedback, and hates to over-engineer anything. If it sounds like too much pie-in-the-sky design, I'm probably not paying much attention. |
|@xumins|  Our new five-star Program Manager. Xumin is the sheriff, she keeps the law. If there are rules that we need to play by, Xumin make us follow them.   |
|@bherila|  If Xumin is the sheriff, then Ben is the US Marshal -- he's hunted down and removed more blocking issues than I can even count. He's taken us from nothing to where we are today. If we want to connect with some group inside Microsoft, Ben knows who to talk to and who to have put down.  |


## Understanding the OneGet code repository

OneGet is under rapid development, and so you get to see just how the sausage is being made. I try to keep the master branch clean and buildable, but my own working branch can get pretty damn wild and I make no bones about some of this. I work fast, I make big changes, and I try to keep my eye on the target.

Feel free to clone the repository, and check out the different branches:

### Branches

There are currently three branches in the git repository:

| Branch | Purpose |
| ------- | ---------------------------|
|`master`|  The `master` branch is where the daily builds of OneGet will be made from. At this moment, `master` is empty; I've been making huge sweeping changes since the CTP all over the code base, and it's not stable enough to even build and run quite yet. Before the end of May, this will be build-able and should be the code you're looking for. |
|`ctp`|  The `ctp` branch is a snapshot of the code that was released as the WMF 5.0 CTP back in April. This branch is frozen and here only for completion sake. No pull requests/patches will be taken for this, as it's a dead end. The new `master` branch is where all the new action is taking place. Fun to read, but a bit hacky in places. |
|`wip`|  The `wip` branch is where the current **unstable** and **not-likely-working** coding is taking place. This lets you see where I'm at before stuff actually hits the master branch. Fun to read, but really, the wild-west of code branches. |

## Contributing to OneGet

Contributions to the OneGet project will require the signing of a CLA -- contact @fearthecowboy for details...

In the immediate time frame, we won't be taking pull requests to the core itself, as we still have many masters at Microsoft to keep happy, and I have a lot of release process stuff I have to go thru to make them happy. 

There are some exceptions to the where I can take Pull Requests immediately: 

> Pull Requests to the not-in-core Package Providers (Chocolatey, NuGet, etc) are instantly welcome (uh, as soon as the `master` branch opens up--before the end of May)

> Any unit tests, BVT tests or -Edge only features, we can take pull requests for as well (again, just as soon as the `master` branch opens up--before the end of May)

> Docs, Wiki, content, designs, bugs -- everything gleefully accepted :D
  

## Participating in the OneGet Community

I'm eager to work with anyone who wants to help shape the future of Package Management on Windows -- your opinions, feedback and code can help everyone. 

### Weekly Online Meeeting 

We have an online weekly meeting Friday mornings @ 10:00PDT [via Lync](https://join.microsoft.com/meet/garretts/HZ96LF57)* (everyone welcome!)

You can see archives of the previous meetings available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeKWr5Ekac1SEEvHqIh3g051OyioFwOXN&feature=c4-feed-u)

## What is OneGet?

OneGet is a unified interface to package management systems and aims to make Software Discovery, Installation and Inventory (SDII) work via a common set of cmdlets (and eventually a set of APIs). Regardless of the installation technology underneath, users can use these common cmdlets to install/uninstall packages, add/remove/query package repositories, and query a system for the software installed. Included in this CTP is a prototype implementation of a Chocolatey-compatible package manager that can install existing Chocolatey packages.

With OneGet, you can
* Manage a list of software repositories in which packages can be searched, acquired, and installed
* Search and filter your repositories to find the packages you need
* Seamlessly install and uninstall packages from one or more repositories with a single PowerShell command


### Get Started!

Download  [here](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42316) -- currently it's in the WMF 5.0 CTP (WMF is where you get PowerShell!)  -- once the source is up, we'll post a build of just the OneGet bits.

* Learn how to [use the powershell cmdlets](https://github.com/OneGet/oneget/wiki/cmdlets) 
* Read our [General Q and A](https://github.com/OneGet/oneget/wiki/Q-and-A)
* Learn about the [8 Laws of Software Installation](https://github.com/OneGet/oneget/wiki/8-Laws-of-Software-Installation)
* See the [documentation](https://github.com/OneGet/oneget/wiki) tab for more info.

OneGet should be shipping inside future versions of PowerShell, and by extension, would ship in future versions of Windows.

We'll also be publishing standalone builds, once the source code is published.

And *yes*, we're going to work with the Chocolatey project to have one single chocolatey plugin that meets everyone's needs : [see Rob's post](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/chocolatey/a8WdEoF-M58)
